K11 -- Basics of /static Folder
2021-10-06

NOTABLES:
- The foo file (not foo.html) in the static folder has no file extension.
- The foo file is a plaintext file, when you cat it in the terminal it displays
the text.
- http://localhost:5000/static/foo is not a html page so it won't display a webpage
so we predict it will just try to open the foo file.
- foo.html seems to be a webpage accessible by the /foo.html webpage. In app.py
you might be able to @app.route() a function to foo.html to also edit the webpage
- app.py has access to static folder.

RESULTS:
- Upon entering the commented web link, it prompts you to open the foo file as a plain text file.
- foo.html displays the webpage with the words as expected at http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html
